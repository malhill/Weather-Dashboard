# Weather-Dashboard
The goal here is to use multiple API's (5 day forecast, UV, and Current day) to have a function weather app.

# HTML
* Creating a grid structure to seperate the list, weather cards, and weather data by divs. 

# CSS


# JS
* Multiple AJAX
* Worked on creating and appending classes to the app
* I tried going with the idea of commenting on everything as if im talking to myself for clarity

# Creators Note:
* Putting an AJAX within another AJAX was complex for my brain
* Definitely will work on this more
